This tool aims to provide more functionality that the samtools package provides through the samtools view command, also this tool follows the linux principle that one tool should a specific task and do it well, instead of having a mass of conflicting and incomplete functionality as the samtools executable does.

This tool uses the BAM-tools library hosted at : http://github.com/pezmaster31/bamtools.
