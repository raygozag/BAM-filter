This tool aims to provide more functionality that the samtools package provides, also this tool follows the linux principle that one tool should a specific task and do it well, instead of having a mass of conflicting and incomplete functionality as the samtools executable does.

This tool used the BAM-tools library hosted at : http://github.com/pezmaster31/bamtools.
